# Anka/Coder

> "The Anka/Coder family is a monospaced, courier-width (60% of height; em size 2048x1229) font that contains characters from 437, 866, 1251, 1252 and some other code pages and can be used for source code, terminal windows etc."

It features true bold an italic variants so this font looks good all the time. Those requiring Greek and other character sets should look elsewhere though, Anka/Coder currently only supports common Latin characters. The open source files are hosted on [code.google.com](https://code.google.com/p/anka-coder-fonts/
  ). There are narrow and condensed versions for printing lots of code on little space.

Otherwise, not much is kwown about this font (other than that it looks great).

# Anonymous Pro

[...](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Anonymous+Pro)

Designed by [Mark Simonson](http://www.marksimonson.com), Anonymous Pro is an evolution of the original [Anonymous](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Anonymous), adding lots of character sets and styles. It covers [all the characters (624 glyphs), styles and weights anyone will ever need](http://www.marksimonson.com/assets/content/fonts/AnonymousProSpecimen.pdf). For fans of having lots of code on screen, it even features bitmap versions for really tiny characters (without anti-aliasing). It's a truly professional option with a splash of character.

# Aurulent Sans Mono

> "Aurulent Sans is a sans serif font I'm developing for use as the primary interface font on X Windows on GNU/Linux."
[...](http://delubrum.org)

It's a bit limited, 264 Glyphs, and bold and italic need to be synthesized. The creator is an Associate Professor in the Department of Mathematics of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. While Aurulent may [have its flaws](http://typophile.com/node/31970), and doesn't distinguish the 0's and O's, it's a pretty good looking font considering it basically seems to be an enthusiasts hobby project.

# Average Mono

> "AverageMono is an average of thirteen different fonts which are all derivatives of the public domain "Courier" typeface. Or, rather, a subset of the Western Latin characters in it, minus punctuation, are thus. Everything else is imported wholesale from the GNU FreeMono typeface."
[...](http://openfontlibrary.org/en/font/average-mono)

The origin story for this font is mind boggling, as is its [coverage of languages](http://openfontlibrary.org/en/font/average-mono) (Urdu or Runic anyone?). Not unlikely one enabled the other. Bold and italic are also in. Basically, it may not have the most character (being average and all), but it's hard to find a situation where it won't work.

# Bitstream Vera Sans Mono

> "Vera is a group typeface (font) with a liberal license. It was designed by Jim Lyles from Bitstream, and it is closely based on Bitstream Prima, for which Lyles was also responsible. It is a TrueType font with full hinting instructions, which improve its rendering quality on low-resolution devices such as computer monitors."
[...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitstream_Vera)

If to be copied is the sincerest form of flattery, Jim Lyles has much to be proud of: this has to be the [most copied font ever](http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/index.php?title=Bitstream_Vera_derivatives)). A classic, this font especially well suited for use on Windows since it's fully hinted. Although Bitstream did a wonderful job, its 300 glyphs can be limiting. Luckily, it has been open sourced, inspiring the [DejaVu Project](http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Main_Page) to expand the coverage of this wonderful typeface.

# Consolamono

> "It's my old unfinished font. I made some sketches of several glyphs 5-6 years ago, and I never finished this. Now I made missing glyphs, did changes of some glyphs and turn into monospaced font. The font is updated now (2011.06.17) - I made all glyphs for Latin Extended B, Cyrillic, and Cyrillic Supplement. Added Bold version 2012.11.16 2013.01.27"

This is a beautiful, rounded font with loads of character. While it might not look like the most obvious choice for a programming font it's very well made and its coverage is very good. Sadly, Consolamono doesn't come with true italics. However, if you're looking for something fun and different, this might just be it.

Cousine offers improved on-screen readability characteristics and the pan-European WGL character set and solves the needs of developers looking for width-compatible fonts to address document portability across platforms."
[...](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Cousine)

This font was designed by Steve Matteson, more widely known for his work on the Droid fontfaces you'll find on any Android device. It was created especially for on-screen use, and covers regular, bold and italic in an amazing 2391 Glyphs. Compatibility might be its strongest feat, but it's a serious font for every day use.

Cutive is a thin and light typewriter font with subtle serifs. A fresh and modern take on the classic style, this wonderful writer's typeface covers the basic western character set. It doesn't have true bold and italic, but that shouldn't hold you back. Get your Hemingway on and blog away with this modern classic.

The DejaVu project is open source at its best. Started by expanding the coverage of the Bitstream Vera typeface, it has been in [active development](http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Changelog) for the past ten years. You might not have missed the Turkish Lira sign, but if you did you'll be glad to know it has recently been added. DejaVu has an amazing coverage and has all the styles you'll ever need. It's classic and understated and the goto font for many coders.

The name means fixed system, because its glyphs are monospace or fixed-width (although bolded characters are wider than non-bolded, unlike other monospace fonts such as Courier). It is the oldest font in Windows, and was the system font in Windows 1.0 and 2.0, where it was simply named "System".

Inconsolata draws from many inspirations and sources. I was particularly struck by the beauty of Luc(as) de Groot's Consolas, which is his monospaced design for Microsoft's Vista release.
